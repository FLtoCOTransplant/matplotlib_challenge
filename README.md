How effective are different drugs at controlling the growth of tumors?  That is what this excersize is trying

to determine.

First we cleaned up the data, removing any duplicates.

Then we summarized the data.  What is the mean, mediam, variance, standard deviation, and SEM.

How many mice were in each trial and what was the gender makeup?  This project answers those questions.

What was the efficacy of four of the most promising drugs?  We dig deeper into Capomulin, Ramicane, 

Infubinol, and Ceftamin.

The most promising drug is Capomulin.  How does the drug impact tumor growth in one of the mice?  This code 

will show you (though I couldn't figure out how to make the random "Mouse ID" generator to flow through the

code).

Finally let's compare the average tumor volume to the average mouse weight.  How well do they correlate?
